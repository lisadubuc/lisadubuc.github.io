            <h1>“As We May Think”: a Reading Response
            </h1>
            <p>The reading is text heavy. The beginning of the reading is very confusing. It starts by talking about war
                and peace, scientists and physicists which makes the reader (myself) question what the text is about and
                how it relates to design. It is only when starting to read chapter two that the text becomes more
                related to design by talking about the creation of the machine and placing a time frame using mass
                production. This is when the reader realises that the text is older. Although the text was published in
                1945 the author had quite an interesting and advanced view on the technology he is talking about. Coming
                back to the time frame of the reading, this clears up what the text is about which is, the production of
                technology such as for photography and type. That is not easy to notice at the start like I said before
                since technology is only spoken of by chapter two. In chapter two the reader is presented with
                photography and the different evolutions of cameras. By chapter three, the reading turns toward the
                technology of type. Therefore, typewriters are at the forefront. The next chapters, the author continues
                to talk about the advancements in machines that make it easier for people to work. The author puts
                emphasis on the fact that scientists create these machines. The author talks a lot of logic. The text
                shows a lot about human experience and history from the white man’s perspective who were the ones in the
                forefront of the invention and use of the machines created. A few things I found interesting in the
                reading were mainly about photography such as the invention of the camera and photography was to create
                a new way to record things other than paper or wax. Another interesting thing was that the other says
                that dry photography is sloppy which is funny since many love the aesthetic in this time. A question
                that arose when reading was since scientists have invented all these machines should we consider them
                designers as well? In conclusion, the author clearly had a lot to say about technology and machines for
                his time. He is a real intellect in the topic. Although, for the length of the text, the lack of in
                keeping the reader hooked. After a few chapters my interest faded. The most interesting part for me to
                be honest was about the evolution of photography because I love this form of art. Overall, the text felt
                too heavy with information that did not necessarily have to be put all together, in my opinion. </p>

            <h1>“Writing the History of the Internet”: a Reading Response
            </h1>
            <p>The reading was very interesting. The topic was something I had never heard about before and had never
                asked questions about but now I am left wondering. To begin with the essay argues that the origin of the
                creation of the internet, networks and computers are mixed. There are two different ideas of the origin
                which is one being to advance technology and the other to help communication. Yet, they are both linked
                which created an argument of creates for the invention of the networks. The hackers question the origin
                of the genius wizards who created it. The origins are hard to know since the story of it talks about the
                advancement for the military which is always ambiguous. Although, there seems to have been a lot of
                advancement for the military with the networks and computers for communication and defence systems. The
                military gave a lot of funding to have the technology for the cold war since there was thought of an
                apocalyptic end out of this war and America wanted to be in the lead. The machines made were for
                political advancement which brings the questions were societies supposed to have access to computers and
                networks or was it meant for the military only. Yet in another thought Western technology was meant to
                be inevitable and autonomous. This is why computer design was inevitable. Although, are computers and
                the internet really good for people does it really give freedom or it actually does the opposite. This
                lecture made me think about how the internet can be dangerous as well as freeing. Being behind a screen
                can give much power especially for hackers but for regular people there could be a feeling of being
                watched or listened to and being fed capitalist ideas. Yet, there is so much that can be done with the
                technology such as creating. The lecture was long and information heavy but it was worth the read.
                Therefore, in conclusion, in my understanding the internet origin’s are ambiguous and the prime use for
                it was military use and it probably still is today. Although, the military don't have all the power
                since there are more and more people with knowledge in the field creating the possibility for hackers to
                have a certain power that could be good but dangerous as well. Overall, the reading just caused more
                questioning for the reader in how the role of the internet plays in life.

            <h1>The Great levelling: a video response
            </h1>
            <p>This 2010 one hour documentary is very interesting in how it delivers information to the audience but as
                well gives a view on how our society is not right. Although the documentary looks unbiased I believe it
                gives a bias stance since it keeps repeating how the internet was meant to be a way of freedom for the
                people to explore and express themselves without the constraints of the government or society. The thing
                that really stuck to me was how the wide web was meant to be for everyone to explore and have fun with
                to be able to bring in the talent and skills for anyone and everyone to use and out of nowhere Bill
                Gates just decided to change the concept and make it a business opportunity which in my opinion is very
                american. It is also quite selfish to profit off people's initial idea and take over a big majority of
                the industry platform. People creating softwares for free for people to use were doing what the initial
                creator wanted to give the world a way of changing everything to each other. Gates also brought in the
                issue of surveillance by businesses and by the government having content control as well this is unfair
                and worrisome for the everyday people using the internet for their personal use being afraid of being
                spied on. The documentary also showed how the liberty of people creating could be harmful. The internet
                gave access to anybody to make softwares that could pirate anything. In the film the main example is
                music which artists are not happy about their work just being listened to without being paid for. But
                here again, the project was meant for people to experience freely and with that, the pirating and all it
                becomes a question of money and capitalism. The internet could not escape this idealism which our
                society holds too dear to. The only thing that could escape was wikipedia but even now they are asking
                the users to donate money to them and for what since the information may not be accurate therefore, the
                service is not complete or false. All rounds back to the idea of capitalism this is why there is no
                possibility for the internet to be free and equal for everyone. It is also why companies and people will
                abuse the content and of people on the internet to profit and make money. This is when the wide web
                becomes scary and unsafe because you do not know what profiting people have access to and will do to get
                their money's worth. Therefore, all in all this documentary was very eye opening on how the internet can
                bring controversy.

            <h1>Is Google making us stupid?: a reading response
            </h1>
            <p>This article is very interesting and touches on ideas and possibilities that not many think about and
                should be aware of. Although humans look like they are evolving with technology it kind of seems like
                humans are becoming more lazy and ready to be controlled. The article made me think about this question:
                Are humans becoming machines?. To begin with the author states how harder it is for them to read books
                and writings since the internet became much more available to them. Not only can one find anything they
                need on line but it has affected one's patience and attention. I have found that to be true for myself
                as well but I do enjoy reading books. The author then follows by talking about how the brain would learn
                differently though the different mediums of learning which makes so much sense to me. One who has learnt
                vocabulary will not have the same learning as one who writes by hand as well and reads. Going through
                time and the different learning periods with the different technologies was very interesting. A quote
                that stuck out to me was “the brain must be wired differently” or something similar to that phrasing
                since it is normal for one to have a different understanding of things depending on the level of
                hardness the knowledge was acquired. The more technology advances the more the human brain has less to
                do to get knowledge creating laziness of the brain. When the reading made me think that it was at that
                moment I understood the meaning of the title since google makes one’s effort of finding information so
                easy, effortless. The creepiest part of the reading was the fact that Google wants to install people's
                virtual brains or research databases right in the body. That is the scariest thing that could happen.
                The amount of control Google and governments could have on us would be devastating. People would just
                become robots, machines, numb beings controlled by capitalism and higher classes. No one would have a
                say since everyone would be brainwashed by all the advertisement in our heads going on 24/7. They
                advertise it as advancement but it is a tool of destruction of individualism and liberty of the persone.
                A weapon to silence the people. A weapon of manipulation. I think this is by far the best reading I have
                had in this class. It really got me thinking and worried about the state of the world and of where we
                are heading as a society.

            <h1>Databuse: Digital Privacy and the Mosaic: A reading response
            </h1>
            <p>The essay Databuse: Digital Privacy and the Mosaic was a very long essay with a lot of information to
                deconstruct as a reader. As a reader the expectation of the text is to revolve around the idea of
                digital privacy yet the beginning which is very long, talks about the concept of privacy through time.
                It was interesting to see the comparison of privacy as property. The only thing that was underwhelming
                was that it was related mainly to US laws. The essay looked a lot at the amendments. The amendments were
                interesting and seeing the link with the property privacy but it was not very relatable. It got
                interesting when the essay went on with digital privacy since it talked about all the issues that people
                face. It also added some irony to the idea of privacy. I love how the author talks about how people do
                not mind getting advertisements in their emails even though they do not want to give information. The
                companies have information on the people with the acceptance of the advertisement to come to them.
                Therefore, it is ironic since people do not want strangers to go through their mail or anything but they
                open their email and the web for everyone to see. There is no more privacy coming onto the web. The
                essay just proved even more how companies abuse people's information to benefit themselves with sales.
                The main issue talked with digital privacy comes from the idea of capitalism entering our minds through
                this media and technology it is a problem. But it is also a problem with the surveillance aspect like
                they mention in the reading. The reading shows only an issue with government surveillance but if the
                government has access pros of technology and of the web can have access as well. The issue comes when it
                is taken for bad reasons. Therefore, it is normal and okay for people to be angry and unwilling to share
                their information freely. The internet allows for people to give their information unnoticeable causing
                people to agree to give what companies, government and dark web to have access to what they want and do
                what they want with it. Where it becomes dangerous is when those information can be used to put someone
                in financial, justice and social trouble. This essay was very informative but way too long to stay
                focused and let all the information be valued equally. This is not the best since it is important to get
                people informed about their information and where it goes and what it does with it. It is important for
                people to know the truth.

            <h1>Everything is a Remix Remastered: a reading response
            </h1>
            <p>The short documentary Everything is a Remix Remasted from 2015 is very interesting and relevant to what
                is happening everyday all around the world. The film starts by itself creating a remix of itself. Coming
                back to what was shown before and creating a known part of it with the same information. I found that
                interesting and well played. I found it interesting that the documentary just decided to use the word
                remix when it is talking about issues of copyright. The first part of the film looks at remixes in music
                and shows how much the artists use each other's beats, lyrics, covers as inspiration. A big influential
                group the film talks about is Led Zeppelin not being shy to copy other artists and use it as their own.
                They had no shame in saying it was their original art when there was a lot of proof against it. Yet,
                there were no legal actions taken against them. For the second part of the film Hollywood is put under
                the microscope. The film industry has not been original for many years. They go with what works. Doing
                remakes as well as sequels and getting inspirations from comics and books to create films. They go with
                what works. Even when it comes to genre of movies they do not change much from the types and subtypes
                they are all similar. These two parts made me wonder how much people just consume the same thing all the
                time and they pay for it. People say they want new things yet stay safe with something similar to what
                they had before. The rest of the film looked at intellectual property and web property. Ideas were seen
                as things that could help the common good until someone decided it was property to have an idea
                therefore making it hard for people to copy but as well allowing to make a lot of money with an idea.
                Any idea becomes intellectual property. This caused people to be able to have lawsuits to protect their
                property; that is an idea and people could not copy it. This also caused limitation of artists since the
                inspiration they took from could be used against them if people decided it was copied. As for web
                property it made things harder to determine what was copied or not since ideas are so vague when it came
                to coding. Therefore, in question of web copyright it is harder to deduce what is and what is not
                copied. This documentary is really opening on if coping is bad or socially constructed to be bad.
                Shouldn't it be okay to copy an idea if it is for the greater good of people? Isn't it bad creating or
                coping for the simple reason of getting money? This documentary raises a lot of questions on people’s
                behavior and what is considered right.

            <h1>The Yes Men Fix The World: a reading response
            </h1>
            <p>The Yes men Fix the World documentary is a masterpiece. It is an eye changing documentary about how the
                world is runned. It is a serious film although it has comedic turns which make it even more enjoyable to
                watch. With their comedic turns they are about to discredit the people they interview and oppose. It is
                crazy to me how people were not able to recognize them since they have been in the news multiple times.
                They were still able to make more hoax and make companies look stupid for not being more humaintairian.
                I found it a little unbelievable how the news made them look like the bad guys and how the people who
                needed help would hate them when the people who are affected were actually glad that people were paying
                attention to the issues they were living and were hoping that would make a change in how they are being
                treated by the companies and government. I think that the Yes Men even if they made some pain they were
                trying to expose years of wrong which is much better than all the companies and the government being in
                denial of the world's situation. The issue with the world is clearly money. Money is the one thing that
                seems to relate everything together. If there is a disaster there can be profit made therefore why try
                and prevent it. This can be seen with war and natural disasters. For wars countries sell weapons to the
                fighting countries. Arms companies make a lot of profit and investors as will. As for natural disasters,
                companies sell the land after it is rebuilt. Plans that were not approved can be approved because they
                have the money to make it happen. Capitalism is a vicious game. The system works for the rich so they
                can get richer while the poor stay poor and in misere. The documentary was good in showing the corrupt
                side of the capitalist system and was able to make fun of it at the same time which was very
                entertaining. It was also able to show the real issues that were happening and how it was affecting the
                people without being hard for the viewer due to the comedy they put into it. It was nice that they got
                the people that were affected to talk because they had a voice as well and it made it not only an
                activist documentary but a peoples’ documentary. The film is surely biased since the Yes Men are against
                capitalism and for global warming change and people activists. Even if the film is biased it provides a
                lot of information on behavior of the people in the capitalist game since they pretend to be official
                therefore we have the real reaction of people which is shocking.
