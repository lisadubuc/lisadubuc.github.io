            <h1>“As We May Think”: a Reading Response
            </h1>
            <p>The reading is text heavy. The beginning of the reading is very confusing. It starts by talking about war
                and peace, scientists and physicists which makes the reader (myself) question what the text is about and
                how it relates to design. It is only when starting to read chapter two that the text becomes more
                related to design by talking about the creation of the machine and placing a time frame using mass
                production. This is when the reader realises that the text is older. Although the text was published in
                1945 the author had quite an interesting and advanced view on the technology he is talking about. Coming
                back to the time frame of the reading, this clears up what the text is about which is, the production of
                technology such as for photography and type. That is not easy to notice at the start like I said before
                since technology is only spoken of by chapter two. In chapter two the reader is presented with
                photography and the different evolutions of cameras. By chapter three, the reading turns toward the
                technology of type. Therefore, typewriters are at the forefront. The next chapters, the author continues
                to talk about the advancements in machines that make it easier for people to work. The author puts
                emphasis on the fact that scientists create these machines. The author talks a lot of logic. The text
                shows a lot about human experience and history from the white man’s perspective who were the ones in the
                forefront of the invention and use of the machines created. A few things I found interesting in the
                reading were mainly about photography such as the invention of the camera and photography was to create
                a new way to record things other than paper or wax. Another interesting thing was that the other says
                that dry photography is sloppy which is funny since many love the aesthetic in this time. A question
                that arose when reading was since scientists have invented all these machines should we consider them
                designers as well? In conclusion, the author clearly had a lot to say about technology and machines for
                his time. He is a real intellect in the topic. Although, for the length of the text, the lack of in
                keeping the reader hooked. After a few chapters my interest faded. The most interesting part for me to
                be honest was about the evolution of photography because I love this form of art. Overall, the text felt
                too heavy with information that did not necessarily have to be put all together, in my opinion. </p>

            <h1>“Writing the History of the Internet”: a Reading Response
            </h1>
            <p>The reading was very interesting. The topic was something I had never heard about before and had never
                asked questions about but now I am left wondering. To begin with the essay argues that the origin of the
                creation of the internet, networks and computers are mixed. There are two different ideas of the origin
                which is one being to advance technology and the other to help communication. Yet, they are both linked
                which created an argument of creates for the invention of the networks. The hackers question the origin
                of the genius wizards who created it. The origins are hard to know since the story of it talks about the
                advancement for the military which is always ambiguous. Although, there seems to have been a lot of
                advancement for the military with the networks and computers for communication and defence systems. The
                military gave a lot of funding to have the technology for the cold war since there was thought of an
                apocalyptic end out of this war and America wanted to be in the lead. The machines made were for
                political advancement which brings the questions were societies supposed to have access to computers and
                networks or was it meant for the military only. Yet in another thought Western technology was meant to
                be inevitable and autonomous. This is why computer design was inevitable. Although, are computers and
                the internet really good for people does it really give freedom or it actually does the opposite. This
                lecture made me think about how the internet can be dangerous as well as freeing. Being behind a screen
                can give much power especially for hackers but for regular people there could be a feeling of being
                watched or listened to and being fed capitalist ideas. Yet, there is so much that can be done with the
                technology such as creating. The lecture was long and information heavy but it was worth the read.
                Therefore, in conclusion, in my understanding the internet origin’s are ambiguous and the prime use for
                it was military use and it probably still is today. Although, the military don't have all the power
                since there are more and more people with knowledge in the field creating the possibility for hackers to
                have a certain power that could be good but dangerous as well. Overall, the reading just caused more
                questioning for the reader in how the role of the internet plays in life.

            <h1>The Great levelling: a video response
            </h1>
            <p>This 2010 one hour documentary is very interesting in how it delivers information to the audience but as
                well gives a view on how our society is not right. Although the documentary looks unbiased I believe it
                gives a bias stance since it keeps repeating how the internet was meant to be a way of freedom for the
                people to explore and express themselves without the constraints of the government or society. The thing
                that really stuck to me was how the wide web was meant to be for everyone to explore and have fun with
                to be able to bring in the talent and skills for anyone and everyone to use and out of nowhere Bill
                Gates just decided to change the concept and make it a business opportunity which in my opinion is very
                american. It is also quite selfish to profit off people's initial idea and take over a big majority of
                the industry platform. People creating softwares for free for people to use were doing what the initial
                creator wanted to give the world a way of changing everything to each other. Gates also brought in the
                issue of surveillance by businesses and by the government having content control as well this is unfair
                and worrisome for the everyday people using the internet for their personal use being afraid of being
                spied on. The documentary also showed how the liberty of people creating could be harmful. The internet
                gave access to anybody to make softwares that could pirate anything. In the film the main example is
                music which artists are not happy about their work just being listened to without being paid for. But
                here again, the project was meant for people to experience freely and with that, the pirating and all it
                becomes a question of money and capitalism. The internet could not escape this idealism which our
                society holds too dear to. The only thing that could escape was wikipedia but even now they are asking
                the users to donate money to them and for what since the information may not be accurate therefore, the
                service is not complete or false. All rounds back to the idea of capitalism this is why there is no
                possibility for the internet to be free and equal for everyone. It is also why companies and people will
                abuse the content and of people on the internet to profit and make money. This is when the wide web
                becomes scary and unsafe because you do not know what profiting people have access to and will do to get
                their money's worth. Therefore, all in all this documentary was very eye opening on how the internet can
                bring controversy.
