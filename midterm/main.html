            <h1>World Hunger is Still an Issue
            </h1>
            <p> The issue of world hunger seems to have taken the sidebar due to all the crazy things that have been
                happening in the world in the year. To begin with it is important to define hunger. Hunger can be
                associated with food deprivation or undernourishment (For Action Against Hunger). In a scientific way it
                is referred to when someone has less than 1,800 calories per day (For Action Against Hunger). The cause
                for hunger is often related to food security. Food security describes food availability, access, and
                utilization (For Action Against Hunger). Therefore, one needs to have access to enough safe and
                nutritious food to be able to function properly everyday to be considered food secure (For Action
                Against Hunger). The world has the possibility of feeding the whole world yet, world hunger has not
                stopped. There are more than 690 million people still going hungry (For Action Against Hunger). It would
                be thought that the issue being so big would have been dealt with and would be decreasing but actually
                it is on the rise, affecting 8.9 percent of people globally (For Action Against Hunger). It has been on
                the rise since 2015 (United Nations). One in nine people do not get enough food to be healthy and lead
                an active life (United Nations). The risk of hunger is greater than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis
                combined (United Nations). There are 8 percent of the population in North America and Europe who have
                issues with Hunger (United Nations). Africa has the most with 20 percent (United Nations). Latin America
                and the Caribbean have been rising on the scale of hunger although its prevalence is still below 7
                percent (United Nations). In Asia the population that is undernourished is 12 percent (United Nations).
                World hunger can be closely linked with poverty. </p>

            <p> The interactions of social, political, demographic, and societal factors causes the lack or the change
                in poverty therefore of food scarcity for some people (For Action Against Hunger). The UN gives the
                information of: “For two decades, leading up to the millennium, global demand for food had increased
                steadily, along with growth in the world’s population, record harvests, new technologies, improvements
                in incomes, and the diversification of diets.” (United Nations). Due to Rising production and stronger
                growth in demand since 2004 the prices for food has risen (United Nations). The increase of oil priced
                in 2007 caused increases in fertilizer and other food production costs. (United Nations). A key event
                caused certain key importers purchasing grains at any price to maintain domestic supplies (United
                Nations). This event was the global economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 which undermined food security in
                many countries (United Nations). Over the years, the UN Security Council found that a big result of the
                food crisis was related to conflicts (For Action Against Hunger). It is often at its worst when the
                conflict is prolonged and institutions are weakened (For Action Against Hunger). In 2020, it is also
                found that it is even worse with conflicts related to climate-related shocks (For Action Against
                Hunger). More and more, natural disasters related to climate change have challenged countries with food
                security and availability (For Action Against Hunger). </p>

            <p> The UN had a goal to have a Zero Hunger Target by 2030 but this goal would not be achieved (United
                Nations). In 2008, the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis was established by the
                UN (United Nations). The goal of the Task Force is to “promote a comprehensive and unified response of
                the international community to the challenge of achieving global food and nutrition security.” (United
                Nations). The UN put in place in the 2000s the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to fight poverty
                which remained in place until 2015 (United Nations). It was the most successful anti-poverty movement in
                history (United Nations). The goal of the Millennium Development Goals was to reduce by half the
                proportion of people living in extreme poverty (United Nations). This was achieved in 2010 when the
                deadline for this achievement was meant to be in 2015 which is a greater progress (United Nations). This
                caused for undernourished people in the developing regions fell by almost half (United Nations). This
                improvement does not change the fact that world hunger has been back on the rise. There is the need for
                more awareness and progress to be made with the issue. It has been put on the back road for a while due
                to all the extreme situations happening in the world right now. Although, these extreme situations are
                also related to being a cause for the hunger in the world. Covid does not help in the situation due to
                all the restrictions put in place and the lockdowns to try and stop the risk of spreading. Therefore,
                there is even more need to stop the increase of hunger and stop it completely.
