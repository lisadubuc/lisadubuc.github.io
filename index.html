			<h1>Note About the Artist</h1>
			<p>I’m a third year undergraduate student at Concordia University in the Design program. I am mainly
				interested in game design but I would also love to be able to make a difference in the world by doing
				shock advertisements. I would like to be able to show the true nature of the world and make people want
				to change and help make a change. Ideally I would love to do some field work as well by taking the shock
				imagery but this is to be determined. I also love to use design for interior and architectural design. I
				do still enjoy coding although it can be frustrating at times. I am just a slow learner but hopefully my
				work will be successful on this website. Enjoy and find all you need to see how I use my coding to
				create my work. </p>
